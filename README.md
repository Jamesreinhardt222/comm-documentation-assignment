### BCIT slack guide

Hello everyone. Due to COVID-19 situation, many students and instructors are experiencing difficulties in communication. This guide is the basic slack guide to help BCIT instructors to communicate better with students. 

This guide includes information about:
-	Making your account

-	Setting up your workspace

-	Managing channel

-	Integrating external apps for extra features.

### How We Came Up With This Idea

Due to COVID-19 situation, we had to discuss our ideas remotely. As the situation got worse, we had to finish our projects remotely without seeing each other. We kept contact with each other over Slack because some of our instructors were already using it to teach their classes. However, other instructors who were not using Slack and had difficulties communicating with students. So we decided to make a guide to teach them how to use it.

### How We Created Our Guide

Thanks to our Java and Python professor Chris Thompson, we were already using Slack as main method of communication; consequently, we were familiar with the service. Also, we created our own workspace to examine extra features ourselves so we can write a better guide.

### Using Version Control with JetBrains WebStorm.

We collaborated remotely using WebStorm from JetBrains. WebStorm can create a project by cloning the Git features, that makes it easier to push and pull from a repository.

### Using a Theme

For this project, Jekyllâ€™s open source theme for documentation with built-in search was used. We forked this repository and made changes to create our documentation. More information about this open source theme can be found in the ["just the docs" page](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

### Learning Outcome of This Project.

Although we were familiar with Slack, there were a lot of features that we have not used it before. As we learned by trying it ourselves, we realized the importance of chronological instructions for creating a guide. Also, rather than only using words, we could explain concepts more effectively using images.

Collaborating remotely was hard, especially when we were not able to meet each other due to Covid-19 situation. We learned importance of communication and how using version control through git is an essential skill for group projects.
.
Most importantly, we learned that every program needs a guide. When a project is done, the people who worked on the project can be very familiar with how everything works and the features inside it. However, even a perfectly designed program might be hard for someone who try it for the first time. If a program has helpful instructions for its features and processes, it will be easier and more popular to use. 


Thank you for reading our Slack guide and we hope you enjoyed it!

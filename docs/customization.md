# Managing Channel

This section explains how to create, rename, and delete channels in your workspace.  Channels are one of the most useful features of slack, allowing you to divide the different tasks and topics in your project into manageable sections.

## Creating a Channel
Creating a channel is a fairly quick process.  You have the option of making a public channel that everyone in your workspace can access, or a private channel that can only be accessed by selected members.

1.  To start, click on plus sign beside the channel dropdown menu.

To make a private channel, simply click the switch marked "make private."

4. Click the green button labelled "create" at the bottom right.


## Renaming a channel
If you are a workspace owner or admin, you can rename any of the channels in your workspace.  Other members without special priviledges can only rename channels they created themselves




## Deleting a channel

For styles that aren't defined as a variables, you may want to modify specific CSS classes. To add your own CSS overrides at the end of the cascade, edit `_sass/overrides.scss`. This will allow for all overrides to be kept in a single file, and for any upstream changes to still be applied.

For example, if you'd like to add your own styles for printing a page, you could add the following styles.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```scss
// Print-only styles.
@media print {
  .side-bar, .page-header { display: none; }
  .main-content { max-width: auto; margin: 1em;}
}
```

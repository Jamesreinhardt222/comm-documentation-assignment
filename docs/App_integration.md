4.Select the account option you want to use.
In this example we used Zoom, a video-recording and conference platform.  Adding it to slack brings up two options, 
â€œUse a company account" or "Use an individual account".

## Managing an app
If you want to find out more information about an app, or decide you don't want a particular feature installed on your workspace, slack makes it very easy to manage your apps.

## Navigating to an app's channel
If you click on an apps name in the sidebar, it wil open that app's channel, and show common commands and features for it.
